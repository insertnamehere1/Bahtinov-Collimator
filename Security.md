<h1>üîè Code Signing Policy</h1>

As of SkyCal v3.1, the ClickOnce installer and all distributed executables are digitally code-signed.
Code signing is performed automatically through [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/)
, with a trusted certificate provided by the SignPath Foundation OSS Program.

This process verifies the authenticity and integrity of every SkyCal release and ensures the application has not been altered after signing.

## Overview
SkyCal is designed with a clear privacy principle:  
**Your data stays on your computer.**

SkyCal performs all image processing, calculations, and analysis locally on your system.  
A network connection is **not required** for normal operation.

SkyCal does **not** communicate with any external servers during normal use.  
The application operates fully offline unless you manually enable or request an update check.

When performing an update check, SkyCal connects **only** to the official [SkyCal GitHub repository](https://github.com/insertnamehere1/Bahtinov-Collimator) to verify whether a newer version is available.  
No personal information, usage data, or system details are transmitted as part of this process.

There are **no telemetry systems**, **tracking components**, **analytics**, **licensing checks**, or **background network activities** in SkyCal.
