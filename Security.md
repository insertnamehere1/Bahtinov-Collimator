<h1>üîè Code Signing Policy</h1>

As of SkyCal v3.1, the ClickOnce installer and all distributed executables are digitally code-signed.
Code signing is performed automatically through [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/)
, with a trusted certificate provided by the SignPath Foundation OSS Program.

This process verifies the authenticity and integrity of every SkyCal release and ensures the application has not been altered after signing.
